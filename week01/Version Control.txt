Version Control is a heigherarchy system for projects.  It allows you to have a backup of all the important files while being able to edit or update different parts by themselves without it directly affecting other files.  It also is really usful when working in a team allowing each member to clone the repository for their own use and submit to the main branch only what is been updated with or without aproval, or lets you fork it to make your own version for your own needs.  We used Git on our own in WDD class for our websites, and getting a new laptop moving over my homework files was super easy just using "git clone" and my repository link for my website and then loging into git via vscode to let me switch from my pc and laptop for when I needed to go to work.
